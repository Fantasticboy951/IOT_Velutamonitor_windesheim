# Contributing to Raspberry Pi Pico Velutamonitor

## How to Contribute Code

In order to contribute new or updated code, you must first create a GitHub account and fork the original repository to your own account. You can make changes, save them in your repository, then [make a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) against this repository. The pull request will appear [in the repository](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/pulls) where it can be assessed by the maintainers, and if appropriate, merged with the official repository.

### Code Style

If you are contributing new or updated code please match the existing code style.
See the provided technical design document for these rules.
